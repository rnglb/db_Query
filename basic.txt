The UNION operator is used to combine the result-set of two or more SELECT statements.
The UNION operator selects only distinct values by default. To allow duplicate values, use UNION ALL:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The GROUP BY statement is often used with aggregate functions
 (COUNT(), MAX(), MIN(), SUM(), AVG()) to group the result-set by one or more columns.

 SELECT COUNT(CustomerID), Country
FROM Customers
GROUP BY Country
ORDER BY COUNT(CustomerID) DESC;        

SELECT MIN(salary) AS SecondHighestSalary FROM
(SELECT TOP 2 * FROM Employee
WHERE (SELECT COUNT(salary) FROM Employee)>=2
ORDER BY salary);


//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Q--> Sort the distinct salary in descend order and then utilize the LIMIT clause to get the second highest salary.
SELECT 
CASE WHEN ((SELECT COUNT(salary) FROM Employee)>=2) THEN (SELECT DISTINCT
    Salary 
FROM
    Employee
ORDER BY Salary DESC
LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1) 
ELSE NULL
END AS SecondHighestSalary

Q--> NTH second highest salary 
CREATE FUNCTION getNthHighestSalary(N INT) RETURNS INT
BEGIN
DECLARE P INT;
 SET P = N-1;
  RETURN (
      SELECT 
CASE WHEN ((SELECT COUNT(salary) FROM Employee)>=N) THEN (SELECT DISTINCT
    Salary 
FROM
    Employee
ORDER BY Salary DESC
LIMIT 1 OFFSET P) 
ELSE NULL
END AS getNthHighestSalary 
  );
