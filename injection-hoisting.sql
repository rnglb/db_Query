SQL injection
/*
--Batched SQL Statements 
--A batch of SQL statements is a group of two or more SQL statements, separated by semicolons.

SQL injection is a code injection technique that might destroy your database.

SQL injection is one of the most common web hacking techniques.

SQL injection is the placement of malicious code in SQL statements, via web page input.

SQL injection usually occurs when you ask a user for input, like their username/userid, 
and instead of a name/id, the user gives you an SQL statement that you will unknowingly run on your database.

To protect a web site from SQL injection, you can use SQL parameters.
SQL parameters are values that are added to an SQL query at execution time, in a controlled manner.
